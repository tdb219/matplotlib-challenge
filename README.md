Observations and Insights
1. The male to female ratio in this study is almost 50:50, helping reduce any potential bias or skew due to sex.


2. Among the four drugs of top interest (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin), a far smaller final tumor size is observed with Capomulin and Ramicane than Infubinol and Ceftamin, however Infubinol and Ceftamin had a far smaller interquartile range and therefore are likely to produce more consistent results.


3. Capomulin performs quite well in terms of decreasing tumor volume. As a specific example, over the course of the study, mouse S185 saw its tumor volume reduced by half, dropping at fairly consistent rate
